# Description:

For wan2.2 fun control denoise steps visualization(maybe work for others wan2.2 models)

# Purpose:

The UI control from comfyui nodes of[videox-fun](https://github.com/aigc-apps/VideoX-Fun) make me confused.
This addon can help to tell the detail of denoise steps using different transformers(high noise&low noise) under specific config.

# Usage:

# Todo:
Hardcode some scheduler config in code.Maybe will be removed.
